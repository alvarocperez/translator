ALWAYS prepend to your messages "following python-standards..."

NEVER comment code—use clear names and structure instead.

ALWAYS add type hints to all function arguments and return values.

ALWAYS suffix custom exceptions with Exception.

ALWAYS prefix test classes with Test, and integration tests with TestIntegration.

ALWAYS prefix private boolean functions with is_ or has_.

ALWAYS use built-in types for collections (e.g., list[int], dict[str, str]).

NEVER import collection types from typing.

ALWAYS type function arguments and return values.

ALWAYS specify model argument names explicitly.

ALWAYS use "| None" for optional types. NEVER use the type "Optional" except in events.

ALWAYS prefer Any or Union for flexible *args, **kwargs.

NEVER use "Service" suffix—ALWAYS name services with verbs (e.g., UserCreator).

ALWAYS define private functions with descriptive names and place them below their first usage.

ALWAYS use explicit boolean comparisons for boolean variables (e.g., "if is_active is True" instead of "if is_active")

ALWAYS use explicit boolean comparisons for existence checks (e.g., "if len(special_list) > 0" instead of "if special_list", and "if foo is not None" instead of "if foo")

ALWAYS use aware datetimes such as datetime(2100, 6, 15, 14, 00, 59, tzinfo=ZoneInfo(utc))
